Spent a lot of time parsing the input into processable array.

For part 2, I thought I had it in the bag, but had no idea what the LCM thing is, had to look for help in AOC subreddit.

In retrospect, it kinda makes sense, but without any clue from the wording, it's kinda tough to expect anyone who has never encountered this type of problem before would've thought of it.

For example, instead of using the LCM, why can't we just use another magic number?
