A deceptively quite tough puzzle.

I know that it requires recursive function, but it is my weak point, so mostly I'm just coding it as I go and look for references.

Also for the second part, my recursive compare function which uses while is broken. No idea why as it works for the first part, I guess because the array has been mutated because of the shift but the sort function refers to that mutated array.

Anyway, I revert to use the normal for loop, and it's making the code more readable, I guess.
